## **Task 1**
### **first_six_example.py**
- Visualizes the first six examples from the test dataset.

### **my_network.py**
- Contains the definition of the `MyNetwork` class, which represents the architecture of the neural network.

### **train.py**
- Implements the training procedure for the network.
- Records metrics like training loss, test loss, and accuracy for evaluation purposes.

### **eval.py**
- Loads a saved model and evaluates it on the test dataset to measure metrics like accuracy and loss.
- Visualizes predictions or generates evaluation reports.

---

## **Task 2**
### **first_layer.py**
- Visualizes the learned filters and shows how they interact with the input data.

### **eval_hand.py**
- Evaluates the trained model on custom, hand-written digit images.

### **vis_effect.py**
- Visualizes the effects of specific network parameters or architectural changes.

---

## **Task 3**
### **convert_img.py**
- Converts custom images into a format suitable for the trained network.

### **greek_transform.py**
- Implements a custom transformation pipeline for Greek letter images.

### **greek_train.py**
- Trains the model on a dataset of Greek letters.

### **eval_greek.py**
- Evaluates the trained model's performance on Greek letter datasets.

---

## **Task 4**
### **experiment_network.py**
- Implements a customizable deep learning network for automated experiments.

### **experiment_train.py**
- Automates the training of the experimental network for various configurations.

### **vis_experiment.py**
